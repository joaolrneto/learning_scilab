# Learning Scilab
### A pratical guide

## About the book
It is the first book for anyone who wants to know the possibilities of this software. It serves beginners in programming as well as for those who already work with other platforms. As free and open-source software, Scilab is an excellent alternative for those working in scientific computing with proprietary software. This guide aims to present the fundamentals of the environment and the programming language, showing practical examples of its functionalities.


### Book topics:
- Preface
- Chapter 1 - Introduction
- Chapter 2 - Fundamentals of Scilab
- Chapter 3 - Scilab Programming
- Chapter 4 - Data Visualization
- Chapter 5 - Advanced Topics
- Chapter 6 - Applications

The development of the contents resulted from my experience during all academic activities in teaching computer programming for engineering courses, in particular. The topics covered do not exhaust the subject, but offer a factual basis capable of assisting the reader in software resources.

Enjoy!
